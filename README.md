# CS-GY - 9223 Algorithmic Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This repository contains the notebooks associated with my final project for CS-GY 9223: Algorithmic Machine Learning at New York University Tandon School of Engineering. 
The notebooks were run on Google Colab. The linear regression experiment can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rtktZ2YyQdDjZqsnFpkhsKNChL7-cG4G#scrollTo=7bOizRhL2wDb) and the logisitic regression experiment can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NR7vTMvFUCkWVofblkg8f84nZqfnZ1n8?usp=sharing#scrollTo=CikkaH1Qt_eX).

To re-run the notebooks, please follow the Google Colab links.
